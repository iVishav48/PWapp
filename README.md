# 🛍️ Offline-First PWA Storefront

## 📖 Overview
This project is an **offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA)** storefront built using **React (Vite)** for the frontend, **Node.js (Express)** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for data storage.  
It enables users to **browse, add to cart, and checkout even when offline**, syncing all pending actions when the connection is restored.  

The app follows modern PWA principles with service worker caching, IndexedDB persistence, background sync, and connectivity awareness.
